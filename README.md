# bookbot

## Description

BookBot is project that originates from [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot). It's an exercise designed to reinforce the learning completed in the previous modules. (And also my first attempt at developing something using python).

The function of this script is to take text (preferably from a book), analyse its letter & word count and generate a report from it.

This project originally would just use a path the already existed as a variable to select the text but I extended it to use argparse to take a path set by the user.

## How to use
Run the code with an argument like in this example:
``python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt.``
